## Introduction

This project implements an Airline Booking System using a microservices architecture.
The system is designed to handle flight management, bookings, user notifications, and provide a unified API interface.
## üåê System Architecture

Here‚Äôs a visual representation of the system architecture:

### Diagram Description
- **Client:** Initiates requests to the system.
- **API Gateway:** Routes requests to appropriate services.
- **Flight Service:** Handles flight-related operations.
- **Booking Service:** Manages booking processes.
- **Notification Service:** Sends notifications related to bookings.

For more details, refer to the diagram above.

## Microservices

### Flight Service

**Repository:** [https://github.com/navabhi07/Flights-Booking-System](https://github.com/navabhi07/Flights-Booking-System)

**Key Functionalities:**
- CRUD operations for flights
- Search for available flights
- Manage flight schedules and seat availability
- Handle pricing and fare rules

**Technical Aspects:**
- Built with Node.js and Express.js
- Uses Sequelize ORM for database interactions
- RESTful API endpoints
- Middleware for error handling and request validation

### Booking Service

**Repository:** [https://github.com/navabhi07/Boking-Service](https://github.com/navabhi07/Boking-Service)

**Key Functionalities:**
- Create, modify, and cancel bookings
- Retrieve booking information
- Manage passenger details

**Technical Aspects:**
- Developed using Node.js and Express.js
- Sequelize ORM for database operations
- RESTful API for booking operations
- Error handling and logging mechanisms

### API Gateway

**Repository:** [https://github.com/navabhi07/API-Gateway-Airline](https://github.com/navabhi07/API-Gateway-Airline)

**Key Functionalities:**
- Route requests to appropriate microservices
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling
- Perform data aggregation from multiple services

**Technical Aspects:**
- Built with Node.js and Express.js
- Uses `http-proxy-middleware` for request forwarding
- JWT-based authentication
- Redis for rate limiting

### Notification Service

**Repository:** [https://github.com/navabhi07/Notification-Service](https://github.com/navabhi07/Notification-Service)

**Key Functionalities:**
- Send booking confirmations
- Deliver flight status updates
- Provide check-in reminders
- Send promotional communications

**Technical Aspects:**
- Developed using Node.js and Express.js
- Utilizes message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing
- Integrates with email and SMS gateways
- Implements templating system for notifications

## Data Flow

1. Client sends a request to the API Gateway
2. API Gateway authenticates and routes the request
3. Relevant microservice(s) process the request
4. Response is sent back through the API Gateway to the client

## Technical Considerations

### Data Consistency
- Implement distributed transactions or saga pattern
- Use event sourcing for maintaining data consistency

### Scalability and Performance
- Independent scaling of services
- Caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis)
- Database sharding for improved performance



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repositories:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/navabhi07/Flights-Booking-System
   git clone https://github.com/navabhi07/Boking-Service
   git clone https://github.com/navabhi07/API-Gateway-Airline
   git clone https://github.com/navabhi07/Notification-Service
   ```

2. Follow the setup instructions in each repository's README.

3. Ensure all services are running before testing the system.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please check the contributing guidelines in each repository.
